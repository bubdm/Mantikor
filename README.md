## Whats MANTIKOR?
Mantikor is an Open-Source address-resolution spoofing-Tool. The application is written in C# with the use of SharpPcap and PacketDotNet. I created the software to learn more about ARP and NDP Spoofing which results in a better understanding how to prevent and detect it in local networks. 

## How to use MANTIKOR
Mantikor is designed as a console program and can therefore also be executed directly via cmd or powershell. To select an item in the menu, the listed numbers are used. Important is that when defining an IPv4 target, the gateway should also be configured with an IPv4 address. The same is important for IPv6. Mantikor allows to spoof either IPv4/IPv6 or both protocols i.e. ARP and NDP at the same time.
